 Removes the Reddit feed and replaces it with a message reminding you not to stop being distracted by Reddit. That's it. It's still possible to visit other subreddits, but the lack of the Reddit home page should remind
 you that there are more things that you would rather be doing with your life than aimlessly killing time by
 browsing Reddit. 

No more wasting time on Reddit. No more getting distracted type reddit.com into your search bar.
