# RemoveIt

A Chrome extension that completely removes the Reddit feed, and replaces it with a message reminding the user to stop wasting time on Reddit 

No content = no distraction = you stop wasting time on Reddit. Visiting any page on Reddit will instead display a reminder to stop wasting time browsing Reddit.
